     * A number of operators are trying to access a resource in parallel to each other.
     * A maximum of 2 operators should access the resource concurrently. Once 2 operators have entered
     the critical section, others must wait for at least one of them to leave.

     * Use a Semaphore to solve this synchronization problem. Semaphores behave similarly to locks,
     with the exception that they can allow more than 1 thread to enter the critical section.
     * Similar to a lock, a single instance of the Semaphore class must be shared between multiple
     threads, otherwise the threads won't be synchronized.

     * You are allowed to add new code to any of the three provided classes or change the existing
     lines of code, as long as you use a Semaphore to solve this problem.
     * Every time a thread accesses the resource, print its name and the system time.
